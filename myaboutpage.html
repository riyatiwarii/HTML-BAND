            <p>Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career, they have been a power trio[1] with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Sweet Children, and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Green Day: Rock Band includes 44 playable tracks consisting of 47 Green Day songs. An additional 6 songs are available for all three consoles as downloadable content and for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 as part of the special "Plus" edition of the game. With these downloadable songs, the complete albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown can be played, along with additional songs from Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning. The song selection was criticized by some reviewers who felt that many important Green Day songs, especially from Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning, were absent from the game. Others praised the inclusion of complete albums in the game and thought they were fun to play.Green Day received a second Grammy Award for best rock album for 21st Century Breakdown (2009), another ambitious song cycle. It was followed in 2012 by a trilogy—the separately released ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!—that found the band returning to the high-energy immediacy of its punk roots while also drawing inspiration from its classic-rock forebears. Green Day’s next release, Revolution Radio (2016), was a more-focused return to basics. Father of All… (2020) featured throwback garage rock.</p>
